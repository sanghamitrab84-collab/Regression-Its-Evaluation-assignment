        "  **Answeer:** Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to study the relationship between two continuous variables — one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response). It helps in predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the known value of the independent variable by fitting a straight line through the data points.\n",

        "      **Answer:**Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is based on several important statistical assumptions that must be satisfied to ensure that the model’s estimates, predictions, and conclusions are reliable and accurate. These assumptions describe how the variables and the errors (residuals) should behave in the regression model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key assumptions are explained below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) should be linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that a change in X leads to a proportional change in Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "The scatter plot of X and Y should show a straight-line pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If advertising expenditure increases, sales should increase or decrease in a roughly straight-line manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors (4 Marks)\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, the value of one residual should not depend on another.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is especially important when data are collected over time (to avoid autocorrelation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation Example: In time series data, if one year’s error affects the next year’s error, the assumption is violated.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "\n",
        "The variance of residuals should be constant across all levels of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means the spread of residuals should remain the same for small and large values of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the spread increases or decreases, it is called heteroscedasticity, which reduces reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: When plotting residuals vs. predicted values, the points should be evenly spread (no funnel shape).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Residuals\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (errors) should be normally distributed with a mean of zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures that statistical tests like t-tests and F-tests used in regression are valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "A histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals can be used to check this assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Most residuals should cluster around zero with few large errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. No Multicollinearity (for multiple regression; in SLR it means only one X)\n",
        "\n",
        "In Simple Linear Regression, there is only one independent variable, so multicollinearity does not apply.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in multiple regression, independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Measurement Accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "The variables (X and Y) should be measured accurately and without bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "Measurement errors in variables can lead to incorrect estimates of slope and intercept.\n",
        "Meeting these assumptions ensures that the Simple Linear Regression model provides an accurate, unbiased, and reliable understanding of the relationship between variables. Violating these assumptions can lead to incorrect predictions and misleading interpretations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 3: What is heteroscedasticity, and why is it important to address in regression models? **\n",
        "      **Answer: **Heteroscedasticity refers to a situation in regression analysis where the variance of the errors (residuals) is not constant across all levels of the independent variable(s).\n",
        "In simple terms, it means that the spread of residuals increases or decreases as the value of the independent variable changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the variance of residuals remains the same, it is called homoscedasticity.\n",
        "When it changes, the data exhibit heteroscedasticity.\n",

        "In a homoscedastic case, residuals are evenly scattered around zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a heteroscedastic case, residuals show a pattern, such as a funnel shape — either widening or narrowing as X increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Causes of Heteroscedasticity :\n",
        "\n",
        "Large differences in the scale of data (e.g., income vs. expenditure).\n",

        "The regression coefficients (a and b) remain unbiased, but they are no longer efficient (do not have the minimum variance).\n",

        "Incorrect Confidence Intervals and Predictions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Confidence intervals may be too wide or too narrow.\n",
